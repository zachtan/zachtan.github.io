QAC 201 is an introductory data science course open to all undergraduates. It teaches students how to generate testable hypotheses, collect and clean data, conduct descriptive and inferential statistical analyses, and present empirical research findings. Students are allowed to work in either Stata, SAS, or R, and are expected to complete a research project of their own design over the course of the semester. My duties as a teaching apprentice were to peer-tutor students in statistical methods, troubleshoot code, grade and give feedback on assignments, and help in the overall design and execution of student projects.
