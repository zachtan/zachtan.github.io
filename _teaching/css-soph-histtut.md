CSS 240 is the required history tutorial that all CSS majors take in their sophomore year. It is an intensive survey of modern European history from the French Revolution to the Cold War, and students are required to read about 700 pages and produce a 5-7 page essay every week before the tutorial convenes. My duties as the preceptor for history were to hold weekly seminars to cover important concepts from the readings, canvas strategies for the subsequent paper, mark and give feedback on student essays, and prepare the sophomores for their end-of-year comprehensive examinations alongside the other three preceptors (economics, government, and social theory; the other cognate disciplines in the CSS).
