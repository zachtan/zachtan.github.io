Bio
------
Hi, I’m currently a postgraduate student at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/) researching the economics of digital labor platforms through experimental methods.

Alongside my work at the OII, I’m also part of two university research groups: [ConflictNET](http://pcmlp.socleg.ox.ac.uk/conflictnet/) at the Center for Socio-legal Studies and the [Digital Ethics Lab](https://digitalethicslab.oii.ox.ac.uk/), where I examine the topics of internet shutdowns in East Africa and current ethical debates in the ‘gig economy,’ respectively. 

Prior to Oxford, I studied History and the Social Sciences at Wesleyan University, graduating with a major in the [College of Social Studies](https://www.wesleyan.edu/css/), a minor in Data Analysis, and a certificate in Social, Cultural, and Critical Theory, where I was also the preceptor for History my senior year. In addition, I’ve spent time working for a digital art start-up in New York City and as an intern at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University.
