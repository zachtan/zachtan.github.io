Bio
------
Hi! I'm Zach, a postgraduate student at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/) studying digital economic platforms, internet governance and regulation, and AI ethics - with a particular focus on how online workers navigate socio-technical systems of algorithmic control. I'm also engaged in ongoing research at the [Digital Ethics Lab](https://digitalethicslab.oii.ox.ac.uk/), and at the [Centre for Socio-Legal Studies](https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/centres-institutes/centre-socio-legal-studies) at Oxford. I received my undergraduate education in the social sciences and humanities from Wesleyan University, in a multidisciplinary program called the [College of Social Studies](https://www.wesleyan.edu/css/). 

I'm always working on something, so take a look at my current projects and reach out if you would like to know more and/or collaborate.
